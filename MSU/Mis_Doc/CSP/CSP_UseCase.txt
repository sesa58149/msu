exposer of big network architecture and its adaptation for bigger network architecture.
explore and collact pain point for other devices which is there on the network
see the live netwrok will help in to understand the system limitation over the existing architecture.
deep analysis on SG Backup tools so that MSU can cover all the feature which it has and can be replace by MSU
currently MSU only support software upgarde not backup and restore feature is still need to cover.

here is the main foucus from my side while visiting to Gemasolar Plant
	1. Understand the current process of upgrade
	2. Understand the existing archeture which will help us in designe more robust and secure MSU porotocol
	3. Understand how restore and backup process done @site so that we can provide an alternet complete solution over SGBackup
	4. Understand the system limitation over the existing architecture.
	5. Collect pain point so that we can drive more Idea to make proccess faster and easy in future 
	
	Ethernet Architecture
	Solar field
	 complete Solar field devided in to many sub doman ring. 
		Sub domain ring further devided into 11 secondry rings. 
			Secondry rings consist of 38 M340 PLC
	In a broadcast domain max 180 device can come
	
	Plant shape is ecllipse and devided in 3 sector/Ring and sector gave 8-10 group
		each Ring consist of  128 heliostats 
	 
	 Apart from upgrade, backup and restore does SGBackup tool any other silent feature
	 How (Which protocol) SGBackup gether application information from devices
	 what is the frequnecy to check the device for app version
	 how many max device entertain at a time in case of simultenious uses
